# Farma Project

Farma is a user-friendly web application crafted with React.js and Node.js. The primary goal is to facilitate the seamless management of diverse farming activities, encompassing Accounts, Equipments, and Work done. Users can log in to their accounts to efficiently oversee, store, and visualize information related to work completed, payments received, and pending payments for each farmer.
